# Logistic-Regression
->My motive of this project was to get an hands-on experience on the Logistic Regression Algorithm.<br>
->I have attached the data file (adult.data) and also the file describing each feature of the dataset (adult.names)<br>
-> Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))<br>

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.<br>


-> The target variable in this dataset is 'income'.<br>
